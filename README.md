### Requirements

These are the system requirements:

-   `python >=3.6`
-   `git`

### Installing dependencies and script

Once we have installed `python` we must install all the dependecies needed. Please find your computers' shell or command promt (cmd for Windows, terminal for macOS/Linux) and open a new window, then type:

`git clone https://github.com/salvamiguel/tweet-sentiment.git`

> Note: While installing depedencies a bunch of files for de model will be downloaded, this is normal.
